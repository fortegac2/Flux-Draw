# Flux-Draw
#Our project is an application involving the integration of three exercises that will help toddlers build and develop their fine motor skills, 
#while also gaining some educational awareness. There are four screens: the main menu, the exercise menu, and a menu for each activity. 
#The first activity involves drawing over dotted lines that form basic shapes, the second activity involves writing letters, 
#and the final activity consists of completing a maze. The user has the ability to exit each exercise at their own will.
